# SignalsAndSystems
A mathematical analysis project for LTI systems using Fourier coefficients, Monte Carlo methods and Nyquist theorem
## Question 1 - Fourier coefficients
This part of the project contain code that finds a close aproximation to Fourier coefficients of a given function and draw it in diffrent resolutions (reletavly to the number of coefficients).

## Question 2 - Sampling, regeneration by Monte Carlo and Nyquist theorem
This Part contains code that samples a given function in diffrent frequencies and uses the Monte Carlo method to regenerate the original function. The deffrent frequencies is an example for the Nyquist theorem.

## Question 3 - zero padding
This part deals with the problem of sampleing and zero padding in relation to harmonic distortion.
